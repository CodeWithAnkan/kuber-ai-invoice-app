KuberAI is a full-stack, cross-platform mobile application built with React Native and Node.js that revolutionizes personal finance management. It leverages the power of Google's Gemini API to scan and understand invoices, provide intelligent financial analysis, and help users save money with smart, AI-driven insights.

‚ú® Key Features
üìÑ AI Invoice Scanning: Instantly scan physical or digital invoices (images & PDFs). The Gemini vision model automatically extracts the vendor, amount, due date, and assigns a spending category.

ü§ñ AI Financial Coach: Receive personalized, conversational monthly spending reviews. The AI analyzes your habits, compares them to your budget, and provides actionable advice.

üí∏ Smart Deal Finder: For recurring bills, the AI uses Google Search grounding to find better deals on the market, helping you save money on subscriptions and services.

üìä Dynamic Data Visualization: An interactive dashboard with weekly, monthly, and yearly charts to visualize your spending patterns over time.

üîÑ Automated Recurring Bills: Set any invoice as recurring. The backend automatically manages future due dates and sends push notifications when a new billing cycle begins.

üîê Secure User Authentication: Full user sign-up and sign-in functionality powered by Firebase, ensuring all financial data is private and scoped to the individual user.

üîî Hybrid Notification System: A robust system combining backend push notifications (for recurring bills) and offline local notifications (for upcoming due dates).

üîí PIN & Biometric Protection: Users can secure sensitive actions like editing, deleting, or removing a PIN with a 4-digit code.

Full CRUD Functionality: A complete, modern mobile app experience with create, read, update, and delete operations for all your financial data.
